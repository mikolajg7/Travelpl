# Travel.pl University Project
This project is a collaborative effort between Mikołaj Golański and Konrad Kuś, developed as part of our coursework at the University of Economics in Katowice. The primary focus of this project is to conduct performance testing and optimization on web applications.

# Overview
The project utilizes Python, Django, and Locust to build, test, and optimize a web application. The application includes features such as user registration, login, and post creation. The performance of these features is tested using Locust, an open-source load testing tool.
# Future work
We plan to continue refining and expanding this project, with a focus on identifying and optimizing potential performance bottlenecks in the web application.
